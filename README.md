- Hi, I’m Sydney! I am former clinical researcher who is looking to tranistion into the world of data science. I've recently complete Codeacademy's Data Scientist Career Path in February 2022 and am eager to furhter my education in the field. 

- My main language is Python and am familiar with SQL, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and seaborn. I have briefly explored working with text data using natural lanugae processing and am able to build, train and test a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. I am focused on many things at the moment, but am focusing on building back my math skills and portfolio through free online datasets. As I grow, I would dive deepr into NLP and machine learning that would apply to medical research.
