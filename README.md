- Hi, I’m Sydney! I'm a recent MSc graduate in Health Data Science from University College London.
- I'm interested in all things data with a focus on machine learning. 
- I'm currenlty teaching myself R, Java, and HTML/CSS, while strengthening my Python and SQL skills.
- I'm also actively developing my developer skills (just for fun).
