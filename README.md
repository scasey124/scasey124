### About Me:
- I hold a Master of Science (with Distinction) in Health Data Science from University College London (UCL) and a BA (cum laude) in Biochemistry from Mount Holyoke College.
- Before my data jounery, I worked as a biomedical researcher.
- I love learning new technologies and have dabbled in data engineering over the past year.
- I am interested in exploring how ML/AI intersects with human-centered design, ethics, and privacy, especially in science & healthcare. My goal is to create solutions that are both innovative and responsible.

#### Tools:
- Primary languages: Python | SQL | R | STATA 
  - Secondary languages: HTML | CSS | Javascript 
  - Tertiary languages: Java (very much a beginner) 

#### Currently working on:
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science)
- New data projects - a mix of data engineering & data science (focus on ML & AI)
- [My portfolio webiste](https://scasey124.github.io/) & this page

##### Fun fact:
- If I'm not working, you'll probably find me adding another hobby to my already long list.
